## HTML and images

Rmd has syntax for embedding images, and this works for several image types. Here's code for a gif, and the result. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

This only gets you so far in terms of customization. I generally use HTML for anything fancier than this. For example, this is the code I used to embed Ted in the [about page](about.html):


```{html}
<img src="images/ted.jpg" style="width:35%; border:10px solid; margin-left: 20px" align="right">
```

This has both the usual image stuff, and some styling on top of that. 

## Styling

The bit about styling gives a hint about how HTML / CSS work. HTML tags have attributes that modify the default behavior; the `style` attribute is something that gets a lot of attention. You can see (and modify) this in the `<img>` tag, but all the other HTML stuff on a page has styling, too. 

You have some options in modifying style attributes:

* Modify a specific tag
* Add CSS in the page header
* Add CSS to the site

"CSS" is cascading style sheets -- the style in a site gets overruled by style in a page-specific CSS, and the page specific gets overruled by styling in a tag. 


## Create and add a CSS file

First you need to know what elements of the default style you want to overrule. Common things are:

* Font sizes / colors, especially in headers
* Major color choices (navbar, links, etc)
* Other things you liked on someone's website

This is another area where stealing is common. 

An example style sheet is below.

```{css, eval = FALSE}
.navbar-default {
    background-color: #1D4F91!important;
    border-color: #1D4F91;

}

.navbar-nav li a:hover, .navbar-nav > .active > a {
  background-color: #0077C8 !important; 
  text-decoration: none;
}

h1 {
  color: #1D4F91
	font-size: 32px;

}

h2 {
  color: #1D4F91
}

h3 {
  color: #1D4F91
	font-size: 20px;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 100;
}

h4 {
  color: #1D4F91
}

h5 {
  color: #75787B
}
```

Let's say you've saved this as `styles.css`. You can include the style sheet by modifying the site (or page, I guess) YML to include:

```{yaml}
output:
  html_document:
    css: style.css
```

Note: I can also just add this to a page in a `{css}` chunk, and it will apply to that page.


## Linking to an external style sheet

Typically, the style sheets you want to use are "local" -- there's a local bootswatch theme you want to use, and maybe a style sheet to layer on top of that. Sometimes you want to draw on something else, though -- my personal website uses the some of the fontawesome styling. To do that, I used two steps:

* create a `header.html` file that contains code to link to these sheets
* add the header to my site via `_site.yml`.

The `header.html` file contains the lines:

```{html}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/latest/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
<script defer src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.3/js/all.js"></script>
<script defer src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.0/js/v4-shims.js"></script>
```

And the `_site.yml` includes:

```{yml}
output:
  html_document:
    include:
      in_header: header.html
```
